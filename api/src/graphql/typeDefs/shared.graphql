# Note: In the current version of GraphQL, you can’t have an empty
# type even if you intend to extend it later. So we need to make sure
# the Query type has at least one field — in this case we can add a fake _empty
# field. Hopefully in future versions it will be possible to have an empty type
# to be extended later.
